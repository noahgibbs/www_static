              Marketing groups in their own language. I know
              conversion rates and A/B tests, statistical significance, email marketing and how to present data
              to a less-technical audience. That means <b>more engineering support for

              As for "led projects": I was an architect on a UI framework for ACCESS Systems Americas. I've led
              a Ruby web framework project and an analytics rescue project at OnLive. I
              was a tech lead for a deployment project and architect for a Cassandra-backed
              metrics system at Ooyala. There have been other projects, but those are the big
              recent ones.
            </p>

              I've spoken at two major conferences: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh5MYvNXt0A" target="_blank">GoGaRuCo</a>
              and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2nGBUuvVmc" target="_blank">Cassandra Summit</a>. I've
              spoken at about 10 local meetups, including the OnLive ones. I've had a few
              interviews like
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evDJMLb1d28" target="_blank">The Ruby Hangout</a>
              and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu1lnbaGob4" target="_blank">meetup with the
              Toronto Ruby Brigade</a>.
              I've been on <a href="http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/">The Ruby Rogues podcast</a> (scheduled for a second one, too!), created a

              My book, <a href="http://rebuilding-rails.com" target="_blank">Rebuilding Rails</a>, has
              sold over 700 copies as I write this. I sell entirely independently, and I sell one of
              the few books for intermediate Rails programmers. Ask around at your local Ruby or Rails meetup
              &mdash; folks have heard of it, and one or two may own a copy.

              I wrote the open-source <a href="http://github.com/noahgibbs/madscience" target="_blank">Ruby Mad Science</a>
              software for my deployment class, <a href="http://rails-deploy-in-an-hour.com" target="_blank">Rails Deploy In
              An Hour</a>. You can read through the software, which is basically an integration layer over
              standard tools like Chef, Capistrano and Vagrant that tend to play poorly together. It also has a very
              convenient installer for everything up and down the stack. If you've used this software, you already know why that's
              really useful. It's also bizarrely difficult to get this level of integration outside of giant Enterprise
              products.

              There are a lot of cool things that I <i>didn't</i> mention above because managers and business guys
              tend not to care about them. I started an <a href="http://engineering.onlive.com" target="_blank">OnLive engineering
              blog</a> and did most of the writing for it. I created the <a href="http://github.com/onlive" target="_blank">OnLive GitHub
              organization</a> and wrote a fair bit of the code there. I wrote a number of open-source projects for
              <a href="http://github.com/ooyala" target="_blank">Ooyala</a>. And hey, look through the
              <a href="http://static.angelbob.com/portfolio/#personal/all" target="_blank">personal section of my portfolio</a>,
              especially the later bits. There's some really fun stuff inside.

                  I learned Ruby while standing next to Noah and I have to say that it's the best
                  possible way to do so. He's the go-to guy (read: force multiplier) on so many
                  topics that I've lost track of how many there are. Noah is full-stack: he can
                  go from discussing sales objectives to the algorithmic complexity of message
                  routing in the same breath and tie it all together. I'd work with or hire

                  I have worked closely with Noah for about a year now, and his breadth of knowledge
                  around big data / Cassandra and RoR is unlike any I have ever seen. Noah is well known
                  as competent and a genius around the big data community and has spear headed the efforts
                  to pull OnLive into next generation of NoSQL.

                Noah is a pleasure to work with and a great asset to any organization. He has a rare
                combination of guru expertise and down to earth friendliness and helpfulness. Noah is
                always willing to brainstorm, mentor and otherwise help anyone who asks. When I came to
                OnLive I was somewhat new to Ruby and he took me under his wing and we worked together on
                some really fun and valuable tools. He also took the initiative to begin an Engineering
                blog and an Open Source presence at OnLive and has encouraged me to contribute to both,
                which has been a very rewarding experience! I would happily work with Noah any time!

                  I thoroughly enjoyed working with Noah at OnLive for numerous reasons, not least of
                  which is his attitude. So I suspect he was sought as a manager at OL2 because he fits
                  in so well with this unpretentious culture that focuses on productivity first and egos
                  second, but also because he knows exactly how to remove barriers and optimize the
                  efforts of his team.<br/><br/>

                  In this same vein, he is also tremendously generous with his knowledge. He is not out
                  to show how much more he knows than the rest of the engineering team but instead he is
                  genuinely interested in bringing all of us to his level. And he shows this on a daily basis. <br/><br/>

                  From a company standpoint, this is of great value because he is quite simply brilliant...
                  And for the record, no I have not said that in a review before!

                  Everyone working on the same project as Noah quickly comes to appreciate his strong

                  about everything. <br/><br/>

                he a fantastic programmer with an amazing ability to see the whole of a complex project,
                but he can also clearly and effectively communicate how smaller pieces of the project
                fit together. <br/><br/>

                He is also a fantastic mentor, and takes the time to explain advanced concepts to a
