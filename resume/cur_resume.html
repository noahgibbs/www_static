  This resume is in very plain, very clean HTML for your cut-and-paste
  convenience.
</p>

<p>
  I hear from a <i>lot</i> of recruiters, so please don't expect
  I'll spend time chatting on the phone, getting coffee with you and
  whatnot.  I'm sure you're very nice people, but I get a resume and
  portfolio like
  this by doing a lot of work.  It limits my free time.
