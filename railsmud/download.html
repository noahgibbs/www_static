<h2> Source Code and Downloads </h2>

<p>
  It's very early in development, so there's no stable version yet.
</p>

<p>
  Development is in a <a href="http://github.com/noahgibbs/RailsGame/">GitHub
    repository</a> right now.  You'll need git installed to get the source
  code.  Later, it'll be as simple as <tt>sudo gem install railsgame</tt>.
</p>

<p>
  You can get the occasional glimpse of what's going on with RailsGame on
  my <a href="http://blog.angelbob.com">development blog</a>.
</p>

<h3> Getting Git </h3>

<p>
  Under Ubuntu, you can install git by typing "sudo apt-get install git-core"
  and then download the repository by typing
  "git clone git://github.com/noahgibbs/RailsGame.git /my/sourcedir/railsgame".
</p>

<h3> Using Git </h3>

<p>
  RailsGame can be used a Git submodule under your game tree, as
  RailsMUD does.  Here's
  a <a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitSubmoduleTutorial">tutorial
  on using Git submodules</a> that may be helpful.
</p>

<h2> Building with RailsGame </h2>

<p>
  You'll need a standard Rails setup working -- MySQL, Rails itself,
  RubyGems.  You should be able to run a simple "hello world"-type
  Rails app before you even begin to attempt something like RailsGame
  with multiple auxiliary servers -- make sure Rails works first!
  Get more than the basic "hello world" Rails page, as well, so that
  you can verify that you've got access to a database.  SQLite is *not*
  recommended if you're serious about running this game for long!
</p>

<p>
  It's probably easiest to run Rails locally, first.  Deploying Rails
  is easier than it used to be, but it's still a complicated operation
  with many choices for how to do it.
</p>

<p>
  You'll need several gems installed:
  <tt>gem install rails daemons juggernaut</tt>.
  The plugins you need are already in git (restful_authentication and
  juggernaut, for instance).
</p>

<p>
  There's no compiling needed for RailsGame.  Ruby isn't that kind of
  language.  You can pretty much just run it in place once you have
  the tools it needs installed.
</p>

<p>
  You can either install RailsGame as a plugin (or GemPlugin), or
  you can download a sample app that already uses it, such as
  <a href="http://github.com/noahgibbs/RailsMUD">RailsMUD</a>.
</p>

<h3> Installing </h3>

<p>
  You'll need to copy and customize the file pv.sh into private_variables.sh,
  as the INSTALL file tells you to.  This lets RailsGame know the machine and
  address it's running on, where its mail server is, what you want to name
  your game server, what email address it should direct your admin mail to,
  and so on.  This is important if you'll be running a game server that the
  public can connect to.
</p>

<h3> Running </h3>

<p>
  If Rails and Juggernaut already work well, you can just run the
  "./run_server.sh" script in the top-level RailsGame directory.
