              Looking for a <b><i>full-stack generalist software engineer</i></b>? I've done it all, from UI and application code,
              to Big Data and Analytics, to embedded and multimedia, to deep-dive SQL and NoSQL optimization, to distributed systems design.
              I've worked in 20+ languages over nearly 30 years, from C and assembly building operating systems and device
              drivers to scaling high-traffic Ruby on Rails sites.

              Looking for a <b>lead software engineer</b>? I've been
              <b>technical lead, manager and lead engineer</b> on
              small, highly productive teams at several companies.
              I can turn a simple list of priorities into team goals and then make them happen.
              I'm comfortable operating independently &mdash; for instance, when <b>repairing and rebuilding</b> OnLive's
              unmaintained <b>analytics system</b> with the simple mandate
              <b>"find out how it works, fix it, extend it, don't break production."</b>

              I graduated from Carnegie Mellon (East) for my undergrad

              I've worked for successful startups (Ooyala, PeakStream).

            <p>
              Hiring well-known members of an open-source community can help you recruit in that community.
            </p>

            <p>
              At OnLive, I organized four local meetups for recruiting, drawing crowds of 50+ programmers before we
              limited attendance for space reasons.
              I mentioned OnLive at my <a href="http://gogaruco.com">Golden
              Gate Ruby Conference</a> presentation on
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh5MYvNXt0A" target="_blank">building your own ORM</a>. Ruby people are often
              <b>very hard to recruit</b>, and I was able to <b>find a few "extra"</b> for OnLive.
            </p>

            <p>
              I can give recruiting talks about Ruby, Rails, DevOps, NoSQL tools, analytics, Big Data and many
              other topics. Engineers with those specialties normally cost <b>tens of
              thousands of dollars to recruit</b>. Meetups cost <b>under a hundred dollars</b>, mostly for snacks.
            </p>

            <p> Shall I give a few recruiting meetups for you? </p>

            <p>
              I also present internally about Ruby, Rails, Cassandra, ZooKeeper and other topics &mdash;
              over <b>fifteen talks at OnLive</b> and many at Ooyala before that. I can <b>record my talks</b>
              and you probably want me to.
            </p>

            <h2 class="heading">I Build Products Independently &mdash; Here's Why <b><i>You Really Want That</i></b></h2>

            <div class="right-sidebar">

            </div>

            <p>
              I'm the author of <a href="http://rebuilding-rails.com">Rebuilding Rails</a> and
              <a href="http://rails-deploy-in-an-hour.com">Rails Deploy In An Hour</a>,
              both real costs-money projects that teach programming skills. I sell them independently and do all my own promotion.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are advantages to an employee with those skills. Those advantages <i><b>could</b></i> be yours.
            </p>

            <p>
              I mentioned some: team leadership, self-management, recruiting, on-boarding.
              But <b>money depends on me communicating clearly</b> when I'm selling. So I'm good at it. This makes me
              excellent at instruction, documentation, mentoring and several other processes that
              <b>make your other engineers better</b>, saving salary and reducing time-to-market.
            </p>

            <p>
              My marketing experience also means I can communicate with your Product, Sales and
              Marketing groups in their own language. I know
              conversion rates and A/B tests, statistical significance, email marketing and how to present data
              to a less-technical audience. That means <b>more effective engineering provided to
              Product and Marketing</b> which means <b>better measures of product/market fit</b> which means <b>more money</b>.
              This is roughly the same activity as <b>"growth hacking"</b> &mdash; engineering support makes your
              marketing more effective.
            </p>

            <img src="img/globe-view.png" class="left-sidebar" width="200" height="123" alt="Globe with session count spots"></img>

            <p>
              If you're still pre-profit, don't worry. I can <b>process and present data for funding decks</b>, and I've done that for OnLive:
              analytics data to <b>convince people of the product's potential</b>, in a way that <b>looks good</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
              I can do that for your Marketing group, your product managers and your potential customers and investors as well.

            <p>
              We've talked a lot about what I can do for you. Better yet, you can <b>pick any
              of those benefits</b> and tell me to skip the others. Let's go over
              that list once more:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Technical leadership</li>
              <li>Real business experience</li>
              <li>Deep experience in: Ruby and Rails</li>
              <li>Deep experience in: Analytics and Data Science</li>
              <li>Deep experience in: Deployment and DevOps</li>
              <li>Skilled communicator, teacher, mentor</li>
              <li>Well-known author, speaker and Ruby/open-source personality</li>
              <li>Ready to improve your recruiting and on-boarding</li>

              <li>Able to process and present data effectively for decision-making</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              There's no such thing as "all", of course... If I can <b>do all of these for you</b>, you have other uses in mind too.
              I'm looking forward to it!
            </p>

            <p>
              But there's no <b>such thing as a free lunch</b>, right? Let's talk about what I need from you.
            </p>

            <img src="img/conn_hero.jpg" class="right-sidebar" width="150" height="157" alt="Super hero"></img>

            <p>
              <i class="fa fa-star"></i> I'm looking for a position where I can make a difference. Many of the benefits I suggest
              <b>only work if I have some leverage</b>. That means I need at least a team lead position.
              I need a reasonably free hand to help your company. That also means being paid
              appropriately &mdash;
              <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/" target="_blank">that's
              necessary to make changes stick, too.</a> I can add a lot of value to your company,
              but I need to capture some of it as well.
            </p>

            <p>
              <i class="fa fa-star"></i>I also <b>care a lot about work-life balance</b>. I have two adorable daughters and a wonderful wife.
              If we can <b>negotiate 80% time</b> then you can get a lot of those big advantages above at a lower
              cost. This may make my rate <b>more acceptable to your budget</b>. I don't mind occasional crunch-time
              or odd hours. But <b>I need actual 40-hour weeks most weeks</b> (or 32-hour weeks with 80% time.) Think value,
              not price: the benefits above are worth my salary, and I <i>will</i> achieve them during normal work hours.

              If you're a <b>recruiter</b>, I probably won't find much to say to you. Unfortunately, standard engineer
              positions don't pay what I'm looking for, or have the leverage to make the difference I'm looking to make.
              But <b>RECRUITERS DON'T READ ANYWAY, EVEN ALL-CAPS BOLD</b>, so I'm pretty resigned to copy-and-pasting this into email.

            <h2 class="heading">Too Many Boring Details for Engineers</h2>

            <p>
              I've made some pretty big claims above. You might want to know what's behind them.
              But I don't start with these because that makes for a really boring page.
            </p>

            <p>
              <a href="http://static.angelbob.com/portfolio">Here's my portfolio</a>, including
              professional and personal projects, speaking gigs and interviews. That should
              substantiate things like "used a lot of technologies and languages." My
              <a href="http://github.com/noahgibbs">GitHub profile</a> is kinda the same
              thing with no screenshots ;-)
            </p>

            <p>
              As for "led projects": I was an architect on a UI framework for ACCESS. I've led
              a Ruby web framework project and an analytics rescue project at OnLive. I
              was a tech lead for a deployment project and lead architect for a Cassandra-backed
              metrics system at Ooyala. There have been other things, but those are the big
              recent ones.
            </p>

            <p>
              I've spoken at two major conferences: GoGaRuCo and the Cassandra Summit. I've also
              spoken at maybe 15 local meetups, including the OnLive ones. I've had a few
              online interviews like The Ruby Hangout and a remote meetup with a dev bootcamp
              in Toronto.
              I've also been on The Ruby Rogues (scheduled for a second time!), created a guest episode of RubyTapas
              and generally "hung out with the cool kids" a little in the Ruby community. They know
              who I am, but I'm not Avdi Grimm or anything.
            </p>

            <p>
              My ebook, Rebuilding Rails, has sold 710 copies as I write this. I'm selling
              to a specialist audience (intermediate Rails
              programmers) usually at forty bucks a pop.
              And I'm doing all the sales myself. So that's still quite good.
            </p>

            <p>
              My deployment class, Rails Deploy In An Hour, is quite new as I write this. So it hasn't sold much,
              around $1200 worth, but I've barely started marketing it. That's one reason you didn't see more
              claims about it &mdash; it hasn't existed long. The open-source software attached to it
              is called <a href="http://github.com/noahgibbs/madscience">Ruby Mad Science</a>. Read through it
              if you like. Deployment and provisioning code is painful to write and kind of messy, but I'm
              proud of it!
            </p>

            <p>
              There are also a lot of cool things that I <i>didn't</i> mention above because managers and business guys
              tend not to care about them. I started an <a href="http://engineering.onlive.com">OnLive engineering
              blog</a> and did most of the writing for it. I created the <a href="http://github.com/onlive">GitHub
              organization</a>, too, and wrote a lot of the code there. And hey, look through the
              <a href="http://static.angelbob.com/portfolio/#personal/all">personal section of my portfolio</a>,
              especially the later bits. There's some really fun stuff there.
